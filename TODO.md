# At short term:
* Remove duplicates between `delires/diffusers/diffpir` and `delires`
* create the apply_ methods: both of us
* Implement metrics
* Finish pipeline to save results
* Run experiments for DiffPIR
* Do DPS/PiGDM...

# To check:
* scheduler configs (num_steps for example) for DPS and PiGDM
* get rid file utils_image.py in delires/methods/ because the same file is already present in delires/utils/ and it is a better location I think
